# Project Overview

This project contains folders and files that support the estimation and prediction processes detailed in our study. Each folder has specific functions related to different parts of the analysis.

## Folder Structure

- **County Folders**  
  Each county folder contains files related to:
  - Estimation of carrying capacity for historical years
  - Setting up the probability density function for the respective county
  - Risk estimation (2006-2020) and prediction (2021-2023)
  *Note:* The outputs have been published in the `supplementary.docx` file.

- **Global Warming Folder**  
  This folder pertains to the last part of the paper, demonstrating:
  - How to set up the regression for the defined parameters
  - Execution of related statistical tests

- **Short Term Folder**  
  The Short Term folder focuses on short-term prediction in the paper, providing a step-by-step execution of the methodology.

- **Test MCMC Folder**  
  This folder provides an example of how the carrying capacity was estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.

Each folder contains relevant Python files (`.py`) to execute these steps.
